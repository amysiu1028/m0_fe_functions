# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
I am most proud of knowing how to create functions and it seemed like this assignment went pretty smoothly.

- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
They are powerful so that we can create tools to call upon and use rather than writing loads of code. It helps us create a function for a returned value that we want to reuse many times.

One thing I want more help with is, defining return values and differentiating when I can use a parameter (to my understanding it's defined within the {code block} of the function, and then we can pass through different parameters). Then outside of the function, we can not access any variable that was defined within the function. It's only defined in the function, not outside of the function.
